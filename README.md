# Credit-Scoring

Analyzed and modelled consumer credit behaviours using historical credit card user data to predict the creditworthiness
of future borrowers.
Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting,
SVM, LDA, QDA, Neural Networks, and Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Bernoulli) were applied to identify the most significant
factors in determining credit risk, leading to improved credit scoring models.
